PosixFilesystem
===============

Overview
--------

The PosixFilesystem project is a simple C++ library that abstracts some
of the details of POSIX-based filesystems.

It's features include:

-   Directories
-   Files
-   Advisory locking

Portability
-----------

This library should compile without issues on Mac OS X and Fedora Linux.

It uses the pointer-to-implementation idiom, meaning that it should be
reasonably easily made to work with other platforms as appropriate.

Feedback
--------

This is a very simple library. If you have any suggestions for
improvement, please don't hesitate to let me know.
